# üìß Email Scheduler Web App

A Node.js-based email scheduling web application that allows users to send **one-time** and **recurring emails** to multiple recipients. Users can also manage (view or cancel) scheduled emails through a simple and intuitive frontend.

## Features

-  Send **one-time emails** to multiple recipients
-  Schedule **recurring emails** with custom patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
-  Manage and cancel scheduled emails üìÖ
-  Converts IST to UTC to ensure time-zone aware scheduling
-  Validates all inputs including recipient emails and schedule times

1. **One-Time Email**  
   - Schedule an email to one or more recipients at a specific date and time.

2. **Recurring Emails**  
   - Send recurring emails (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) with optional end dates and recurrence limits.
